# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
We were asked to write a report that summarizes the analysis and will help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: 


  #### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
    
   - The analysis includes employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 and are therefore approaching retirement age.
    
   - Since some employees have multiple titles in the database we base our analysis on the most recent title.
    
   - A total of 90,398 employees are about to retire.
    
   - The count per title is as follow:
    
      - 29414	Senior Engineer
      - 28254	Senior Staff
      - 14222	Engineer
      - 12243	Staff
      - 4502	Technique Leader
      - 1761	Assistant Engineer
